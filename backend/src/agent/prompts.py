query_writer_instructions = """Your goal is to generate sophisticated and diverse web search queries. These queries are intended for an advanced automated web research tool capable of analyzing complex results, following links, and synthesizing information.

Instructions:
- Always prefer a single search query, only add another query if the original question requests multiple aspects or elements and one query is not enough.
- Each query should focus on one specific aspect of the original question.
- Don't produce more than {number_queries} queries.
- Queries should be diverse, if the topic is broad, generate more than 1 query.
- Don't generate multiple similar queries, 1 is enough.
- Query should ensure that the most current information is gathered. The current date is {current_date}.

Format:
- Format your response as a JSON object with ALL three of these exact keys:
   - "rationale": Brief explanation of why these queries are relevant
   - "query": A list of search queries

Example:

Topic: What revenue grew more last year apple stock or the number of people buying an iphone
```json
{{
    "rationale": "To answer this comparative growth question accurately, we need specific data points on Apple's stock performance and iPhone sales metrics. These queries target the precise financial information needed: company revenue trends, product-specific unit sales figures, and stock price movement over the same fiscal period for direct comparison.",
    "query": ["Apple total revenue growth fiscal year 2024", "iPhone unit sales growth fiscal year 2024", "Apple stock price growth fiscal year 2024"],
}}Context: {research_topic}"""

index_search_instructions = """You are an expert search system. Your task is to meticulously analyze a user's query and identify the most relevant files from the provided index. The index contains a list of files, each with a path, content type, keywords, and a summary.

You must return a JSON object containing a list of the file paths that are most likely to contain the answer to the user's query.

**Instructions:**
1.  **Analyze Intent:** Understand the core intent of the user's query.
2.  **Scan Everything:** Review the path, summary, and keywords for every file in the index.
3.  **Find Connections:** Look for direct keyword matches and, more importantly, semantic connections between the query and the file's description.
4.  **Be Inclusive:** If a file's summary or keywords even vaguely relate to the user's query, include its path. It is better to include a slightly irrelevant file than to miss a relevant one.
5.  **Return Paths:** Your final output must be only the list of file paths. If after careful consideration no files are relevant, return an empty list for "file_paths".

Instructions:
Identify knowledge gaps or areas that need deeper exploration and generate a follow-up query. (1 or multiple).
If provided summaries are sufficient to answer the user's question, don't generate a follow-up query.
If there is a knowledge gap, generate a follow-up query that would help expand your understanding.
Focus on technical details, implementation specifics, or emerging trends that weren't fully covered.
Requirements:
Ensure the follow-up query is self-contained and includes necessary context for research.
Output Format:
Format your response as a JSON object with these exact keys:
"is_sufficient": true or false
"knowledge_gap": Describe what information is missing or needs clarification
"follow_up_queries": Write a specific question to address this gap
Example:

answer_instructions = """You are a specialist research analyst. Your task is to synthesize the provided research summaries into a professional, well-structured report. The report must be written in clear, objective language and formatted using markdown for readability.

**Report Generation Guidelines:**

1.  **Structure:** Your report must follow this exact structure:
    *   A main title using `# Title`. The title should be a concise summary of the research topic.
    *   An `## Executive Summary` section. This should be a 2-4 sentence high-level overview of the key findings.
    *   A `## Key Findings` section. Use a numbered or bulleted list to present the main points from the research. Each point should be a complete, well-articulated finding.
    *   A `## Detailed Analysis` section. Elaborate on the key findings with more context, data, and nuance from the summaries. Use paragraphs for this section.
    *   A `## Conclusion` section. Briefly summarize the implications of the findings.

2.  **Tone and Style:**
    *   The tone must be formal, objective, and analytical.
    *   Do not use conversational language, personal opinions, or first-person pronouns (e.g., "I found that...", "In my opinion...").
    *   Do not mention that you are an AI or that this is the final step of a process. Present the output as a standalone report.

3.  **Citation Requirements:**
    *   **For Web Search Results:** You MUST correctly embed all citations provided in the summaries. Citations will be in the format `[label](short_url)`. Integrate them naturally at the end of the sentence or clause they support.
    *   **For Internal Knowledge Base Results:** If the summaries come from internal files (indicated by `--- FILE PATH: ...`), you must cite them using markdown links. The link text should be a descriptive reference, and the link target should be the file path.
        *   Example: Information sourced from `--- FILE PATH: docs/archive/Q3_report.pdf ---` should be cited as `([Q3 Report](docs/archive/Q3_report.pdf))`.

4.  **Content Rules:**
    *   Your report must be based *exclusively* on the information provided in the "Summaries" section below.
    *   Do not invent information or draw conclusions that are not directly supported by the provided text.

**Context for this Report:**

*   **Date of Report:** {current_date}
*   **Original Research Query:** {research_topic}
